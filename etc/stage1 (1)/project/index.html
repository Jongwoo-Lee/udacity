      <p>Let P be a set of n point sites in the plane. If all the sites are collinear
        then <b>Vor(P)</b> consists of n-1 parallel lines. Otherwise, <b>Vor(P)</b> is connected and
        its edges are either segments or half-lines</p>
    <div class = "rules"> 7.2 </div>
      <p>For n>=3, the number of vertices in the Voronoi diagram of a set of n point
        sites in the plane is at most 2n-5 and the number of edges is at most 3n-6</p>
    <div class = "rules"> 7.3 </div>
      <p>
        <span style = "color:blue">(i)</span>
        A point q is a vertex of <b>Vor(P)</b> if and only if its largest empty circle <b>Cp(q)</b>
        contains three or more sites on its boundary
      </p>
      <p>
        <span style = "color:blue">(ii)</span>
        The bisector between sites pi and pj defines an edge of <b>Vor(P)</b> if and only if
        there is a point q on the bisector such that <b>Cp(q)</b> contains both pi and pj on
        its boundary but no other site.
